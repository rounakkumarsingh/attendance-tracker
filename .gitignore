# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms.
#   In such cases, it may be desirable to ignore Pipfile.lock.
# Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The poetry.lock file stores exact versions of dependencies locked by the poetry CLI, and designed
#   to be cross-platform. They also ensure that builds are repeatable.
#   However, it may be desirable to ignore poetry.lock in some cases.
# poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
# pdm.lock
#   pdm stores its caches in the project directory, which should be ignored.
